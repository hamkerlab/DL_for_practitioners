    "To define a neural network in PyTorch, we create a class object which inherits from the `torch.nn.Module`class.\n",

    "As many common layers are predefined in PyTorch already, we use the `torch.nn` sub package to access them. We want to create a network with one input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Each fully-connected layer has the number of inputs and the number of outputs as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer gets the MNIST-images as input which is why the number equals $28 \\times 28$. The output parameter can be freely chosen and expiremented with. It corresponds to the number of neurons in its layer and is a hyperparameter to be tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28*28,120)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we add a second fully-connected layer which needs the number of outputs of the previous layer as its number of inputs. The output, again, is to be experimented with.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that the structure is defined, we define the feedforward processing path through the network in the `forward(self, x)` function. \n",
    "Or to say it differently, we connect the single layers with each other by defining which layer's output becomes which layer's input.\n",
